## Audit Search

#### src/layouts/audit-search/index.js
The `AuditSearch` component provides a user interface for searching and viewing audits in a table format. It fetches audit data from Firestore, excluding the current user's own audits, and uses Fuse.js for fuzzy searching of audit titles. The component includes a search bar for filtering audits by title and displays results in a table with options to respond to each audit.
