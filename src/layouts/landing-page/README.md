## Landing Page

* #### src/layouts/landing-page/index.js
The `LandingPage` component is a functional React component that serves as the landing page for a web application. It uses `react-router-dom` for navigation and `BasicLayout` component to provide the page's structure. The page includes a call-to-action (CTA) section with a title, subtitle, and a "Get Started" button that navigates users to the sign-up page. The component also includes responsive design styles to ensure the layout adapts well across different screen sizes.

The `LandingPage` component does not accept any props, as it serves as a standalone page with predefined content and styles.
